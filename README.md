# Project Odin - Landing Page

Second HTML/CSS assignment from The Odin Project.

## Project Goals

This exercise is mostly focused on getting some flexbox practice. Responsive design is not a concern at this point, though I added a media query to make it somewhat presentable on a phone screen.

I decided to try and get as close as possible to the [original design](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png), rather than doing my own thing. Figured it'll be a good practice, as the differences would be easy to catch.

I still wanted to have some fun with it though, so rather than using lorem ipsums and placeholders, I created a fake product. Hence the smartbryck&trade; - best smartphone in existence, complete with glowing reviews and ridiculous features.
